            This is an opinionated catalog of open source JS packages.
          </h2>
          <p>
            Libraries come and go. The ecosystem evolves rapidly, and that's a
            good thing. But it means you can't rely on your bookmarks. Google
            may not be your best friend either, since it focuses on popular
            results â€” established solutions that may not be the best fit for
            your project.
          </p>
          <p>
            This website indexes new packages and is updated roughly once per
            day, by using both automated scripts and manual curation. It is a
            complete rewrite and grown-up version of <a href="#">React.parts</a>,
            a tiny project that started 2 years ago. Even if you are
            implementing your own solution for your particular problem, this can
            be a good place to find interesting code to learn from.
          </p>
          <p>I hope this catalog is as useful to you as it is to me.</p>
